            <h2>Rio De Janeiro, Brzail</h2>

            <p>Rio De Janeiro has always been towards the top of my list on places to travel! It's wonderful wildlife, amazing beaches, the olympics, and amazing night life is what makes it so appealing to me. In addition it's warm year round, I've always perferd warmer places as I'm not a fan of cold weather.
                Another thing that comes to mind is finally experiencing life outside of the United States. I'm always open to seeing how different people's cultures are in a different country. Finally the food, I'm not too familiar with Brzailian foods, but I'm interested in trying some once I decide to vist.

            <h2>Seattle, WA</h2>

            <p>I love Seattle! Never visted, but I know I'll like it! Due to the simple fact that it's one of the top places to live if you're going to make a career in technology. Also it hosts my favorite team, the Seattle Seahawks and a majority of my favorite players live there. Besides the sports and the tech
            I thinks it's an amazing place for wildlife and hikes. I'm not sure about you but I'd love to see a mountain lion out in the wild or go hiking in the mountains and see the stars at night with a telescope. Another thing too is I want to vist the Space Needle there. St. Louis in my honest opinion isn't the dest city when it comes to skyscrapers or unique buildings which is another thing that makes Seattle so attractive.

            <h2>Phoneix, AZ</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Jermell Howard Jr\Desktop\LaunchCode\html-me-something-Jmell\images\phoenix-arizona-activities-attractions.jpg" width="500" height="350"/>
            <p>Phoneix is a city that just started to grab my attention recently. This is because I personaly feel that it provides the best of Rio in Brzail and the United States combined. Let me explain, it's warm year round, has jaguars, plently of things to do, good wildlife, and I personaly feel like the US is a much better run country than Brzail. Also I personaly feel Arizona might be one of the best spots in the US to view stars. In addition to the grand canyon.
